- Hi, I’m Arcel! I'm a BSc Microbiology Graduate but have decided to re-skill into a field that truly uses my analytical and problem solving skills.
- I’m currently learning the Data Analysis tools SQL and R Programming, but am interested in branching out to other languages such as Python, Java, and HTML5.
Always eager to grow my toolbelt!
